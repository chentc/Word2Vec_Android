# Word2Vec for Android App Corpus

Wording embeddings is a powerful tool that provide vector representations of word meanings. Based on the distributional hypothesis where the context for each word is its nearby words, we can train word embeddings using some large-scale corpus to learn the vector representations. These word vectors, can be used for semantic analysis and other languange classification tasks. 

To facilitate other researchers for basic languange analysis task, many NLP researchers have released some pretrained word embeddings. We havn't found any existing word embeddings on the software engineering vocubuloary, so we decided to train a word2vec model using the Stackoverflow corpus.
